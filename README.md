AutoML Pipeline Project

Overview
This project automates machine learning model selection and hyperparameter tuning using TPOT and scikit-learn. The pipeline is modular, making it easy to customize and expand for different datasets or ML tasks.

Project Structure

Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/AutoML_Project.git
cd AutoML_Project

Step 2: Install Dependencies
You can install all required packages via pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, install the core dependencies manually:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tpot

Usage
Run the complete pipeline using:
python main.py

This will:
Load and preprocess the dataset (data_processing.py)
Train an AutoML model using TPOT (automl_pipeline.py)
Evaluate model performance (evaluate.py)
Export the best model pipeline (best_model.py)

Results
After training, TPOT selects and saves the optimal model pipeline to best_model.py.
You can import and use this script for predictions on new data.

Customization
Custom Dataset: Modify data_processing.py to load and process your dataset.
Model Search Space: Tweak the TPOTClassifier parameters in automl_pipeline.py for faster runs or better accuracy.
Metrics: Expand evaluate.py to include metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, or custom KPIs.
